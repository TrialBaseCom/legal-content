TrialBase, Inc. understands the importance of privacy protection and we make every effort to ensure the information you share with us is secure. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for acquiring, storing, and using the information you provide to us or that we may otherwise collect through our website.

## About TrialBase's Services

TrialBase, Inc. provides (i) court reporting and litigation support services (including transcript-related workflows) and (ii) AI-enabled legal technology services that may help users analyze, summarize, and structure case-related information (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy applies to information collected through our websites and Services, including information submitted by Customers (e.g., law firms, corporations, end users) and their authorized users, and information we process in connection with deposition and litigation services.

For clarity: in many cases, TrialBase acts as a service provider to law firms and corporate Customers. Those Customers may control how they collect and use information in their own practices. This Privacy Policy governs TrialBase's handling of information collected through our websites and Services, and information we process as part of providing our Services.

## How We Collect Personal Information

The personal information we collect, such as your name, physical address, email, and phone number, are used for the purpose of providing our service. Depending on how you interact with us, we may also collect or receive:

- **Account registration details** and authentication information (e.g., login credentials or tokens) for users who create accounts.

- **Business contact information** (e.g., firm/company name, title/role, bar jurisdiction if provided, office location).

- **Communications and support content** (e.g., emails, chat messages, tickets, call recordings where permitted by law).

- **Usage data** about how you interact with the Services (e.g., feature utilization, timestamps, performance logs).

- **Information submitted or uploaded** in connection with litigation support workflows (e.g., deposition notices, scheduling details, transcript requests, exhibit handling instructions), to the extent provided through the website/portal.

## Other Ways We Collect User Information

We may also collect anonymous information from visits to our website through the use of "web beacons", which do not access your personal information, but rather allow us to count users who have visited our websites. This anonymous information is sometimes known as "clickstream data". TrialBase, Inc., or its vendors, may use this data to analyze trends and statistics to help us provide better customer service.

When you visit or log in to our website, cookies and similar technologies may be used by us or our vendors to associate these activities with other personal information they or others have about you, including by association with your name, your email, or other information. We (or service providers on our behalf) may then send marketing communications to you using this information.

In addition, a third party service called Microsoft Clarity may be used to capture how you interact with our website through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve our products/services. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization and fraud/security purposes. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, visit the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

## Cookies and Tracking Controls

You may be able to control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. If you block or delete cookies, certain features of the website may not function properly. Some analytics and fraud/security signals may still be collected where necessary to operate the site, maintain security, and prevent abuse.

## How We Use Personal Information

The information we collect may be used for the following purposes, where necessary:

- To tell you about our products and services;
- To establish and maintain our business relationship with you;
- To provide or otherwise facilitate our products and services;
- Through our third party payment processor, Stripe, to process payment for the products and services you may use; or
- For the management and defense of legal claims and actions, compliance with court orders and other legal obligations and regulatory requirements, and as otherwise permitted or required by law.

## AI-Enabled Services: How We Use Information

If you use TrialBase's AI-enabled features, we may use information submitted to the Services (including documents, transcripts, medical and case-related materials, and associated metadata) to:

- **Ingest, process, analyze, summarize, and transform** materials into structured outputs (e.g., summaries, timelines, narratives, issue spotting, drafts, and other outputs) as part of providing the Services.

- **Operate, secure, troubleshoot, and improve** the reliability of the AI-enabled features.

- **Perform quality assurance**, including investigating errors or abuse, and verifying system performance.

### No Training on Customer Content

We do not use Customer Content to train, fine-tune, or improve any machine learning or artificial intelligence models. Customer Content is used solely to provide and operate the services requested by the customer, including processing, analysis, and generation of outputs at the customer's direction. Customer Content is not retained for model training purposes and is not shared with third parties for such purposes.

### Human Review

To the extent necessary for support, safety, security, and quality assurance, TrialBase personnel and contractors may review limited portions of information, subject to confidentiality obligations and access controls.

## Opt In / Opt Out

You have the choice at any time to refrain from providing personal information to TrialBase, Inc. Please understand, however, that your choice not to provide certain information may limit or prevent us from being able to provide services to you.

Any personal information provided in the email in connection with the submission of the opt-out request will be used solely for the purposes of complying with the request.

## How We Share Your Private Information

TrialBase, Inc. does not disclose any personal information gathered from our website to persons outside of our company, except as described below.

Personal information provided to us in the ordinary course of our provision of services is disclosed to the parties normally expected to receive that information.

However, TrialBase, Inc. shall not be held liable for the security policies and practices of our Customers.

TrialBase, Inc. may release personally identifiable information if legally required to do so by law enforcement or other governmental authority, or under advice of counsel. We may also release personal information to protect the rights or property of TrialBase, Inc. to prevent a crime or protect others from harm.

We may also send personal data, such as your name and email address, to marketing companies who will then contact you to determine feedback and satisfaction with our services. These companies may also send you information on our services. We will only provide these agents and suppliers with the personal information they need to deliver the service we have requested, and who have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may also provide your information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of TrialBase, Inc.'s business to another company. In that case, we will require such a buyer to agree to treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Service Providers and Subprocessors

TrialBase may use third-party vendors (including hosting, analytics, customer support, security, payment processing, communications, and AI infrastructure providers) to help deliver the Services. These vendors may process information on our behalf, subject to contractual confidentiality and security obligations.

### Third-Party Payment Processor

We may also securely collect information about your credit card or bank account through a secure third-party payment processor, Stripe, Inc. This payment information is not held by us. For more information about how Stripe, Inc. collects and uses your data, visit the Stripe Privacy Policy.

It is your responsibility to keep your records with TrialBase, Inc. updated by notifying us by email at the address in this Privacy Policy. We will do our best to respond to all reasonable requests to update your data in a timely manner.

## Data Retention

TrialBase retains information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect TrialBase's legal interests. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of record (including litigation support records) and applicable legal requirements.

## Keeping Information Secure

TrialBase takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect information that we collect and process, but no system or electronic data transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur. We expect that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your personal information when using our Services.
