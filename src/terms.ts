## Service Professional Representations, Warranties, and Use of the Platform

Access to and use of the TrialBase Platform is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old and can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. By accessing or using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.

TrialBase facilitates Pro Service transactions, which may include scheduling, calendar coordination, communicating offers and requests for Pro Services, cloud storage services, video conferencing, displaying a list of Service Professionals profiles, allowing User Attorneys and Service Professionals to send messages to each other, allowing for the booking of an appearance for the provision of Pro Services, assisting in the selection of a Service Professional for certain Attorney Users, and processing payment for certain Pro Services.

Attorney Users understand that any such facilitation does not constitute a warranty in relation to the Pro Services. Service Professionals understand and agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that anyone will engage them for Pro Services. Attorney Users understand that any Pro Services they solicit and/or pay for using the Platform are solicited directly from the Service Professional providing such Pro Services.

TrialBase does not sell, contract to perform, or otherwise provide Pro Services. Any Pro Services solicited, offered, contracted for, or provided by an independent Service Professional are expressly without any representation or warranty from TrialBase other than as expressly provided for herein.

TrialBase does not employ, contract with, or recruit Service Professionals to report or transcribe deposition testimony in a court proceeding or in a deposition.

Service Professionals understand and agree that they are customers of TrialBase, and are not TrialBase employees, contractors, consultants, joint venturers, partners, or agents. Service Professionals acknowledge that they provide their own equipment, select their own jobs, develop their own expertise, are free to do jobs through other platforms and lead sources, and determine their own work schedule.

TrialBase does not control, and has no right to control, the services a Service Professional provides (including the details of how the Service Professional provides such services) if the Service Professional is engaged by an Attorney User or any other person, except as specifically noted herein or on the Platform.

By registering or using the Platform to offer, contract, or provide Pro Services, Service Professionals represent and warrant that they are properly and fully licensed by the appropriate government boards and authorities, as required by applicable laws or regulations to which they may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which they offer their Pro Services and in relation to the specific job they are performing.

Service Professionals otherwise agree to comply with all applicable laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, any other applicable privacy laws in their use of the Platform and any personal information obtained from the Platform.

CSR Users licensed in the State of California specifically represent and warrant that they shall comply with the requirements of California Business and Professions Code §8050(d). TrialBase verifies the good standing status of professional licenses and certifications as reported by Service Professionals and we may limit, block, suspend, deactivate, or cancel a Service Professional's account based on the results of such a verification, with or without notice.

As a Service Professional, you agree and authorize us to use your personal information, such as your full name and license number, to perform such verifications. Service Professionals agree to inform TrialBase of any material changes in their professional license status.

## Marketplace Payments; Fees; Billing; Collections

TrialBase does not offer any professional services directly or indirectly unless specified in a separate contract to which TrialBase is a direct party. Any time an Attorney User pays for or books Pro Services on the Platform or receives a quote in connection with Pro Services, such Attorney User is contracting directly with the Service Professional offering such Pro Service.

Notwithstanding any facilitation of booking or payment, you understand and agree that TrialBase (i) does not sell, offer, provide or subcontract any Pro Service and (ii) is not liable in any way for any Pro Service.

Notwithstanding TrialBase's role as a payment facilitator, each Service Professional who receives Marketplace Payments understands and agrees that they are obligated to perform the Pro Service as outlined in their agreement with the Attorney User and work to remedy any material deviations from such contract.

As an Attorney User making a Marketplace Payment through Stripe, you agree to pay all amounts you owe when due using your preferred payment method. You further authorize Stripe to charge your preferred payment method for amounts you owe when they are due. You must keep all payment information you provide us up-to-date, accurate and complete. When you store a payment method with Stripe, you agree to Stripe's Stored Payment Terms and Conditions.

Do not share your payment card, bank account or other financial information with any other User. We take steps to secure all payment methods and other personal financial information, but we expressly disclaim any liability to you, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages you may suffer as a result of the disclosure of your personal financial information to any unintended recipients.

You agree to notify us of any changes to your account information or termination of your authorization at least five days prior to your next payment.

If your full payment is not processed by us at the same time, you hereby authorize partial debits from your bank account, not to exceed the total amount of your order. You agree to pay any ACH fees or fines you or we incur associated with transactions you authorize. This return fee will vary based on which state you are located in. The return fee may be added to your payment amount and debited from your bank account if we resubmit an ACH debit due to insufficient funds.

We may initiate a collection process or legal action to collect any money owed to us. You agree to pay all our costs for such action, including any reasonable attorneys' fees. Federal law limits your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous, or unauthorized transactions from your bank account based on how quickly you report it to your financial institution.

You must report any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions to your bank no more than 60 days after the disputed transaction appeared on your bank account statement. Please contact your bank for more information about the policies and procedures that apply unauthorized transactions and the limits on your liability.

### Marketplace Payment Disputes

All requests for Marketplace Payment chargebacks, errors, claims, refunds and disputes ("Payment Disputes") will be subject to review by TrialBase in accordance with the rules applicable to the payment method you used to make the Marketplace Payment and will be in TrialBase's absolute discretion. TrialBase is not liable to you under any circumstances for Payment Disputes we are unable to resolve in your favor.

We will normally process a valid written Payment Dispute request within 30 days after we receive it, unless a shorter period is required by law. You may file a Payment Dispute by emailing it to TrialBase support at support@trialbase.com. If you close or deactivate your Account before we adjudicate your Payment Dispute, we will not be able to issue you any amounts you are owed.

We will attempt to pay you any Payment Disputed amounts you are owed using the method with which you made the disputed payment, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so if your payment method information is inaccurate, incomplete, or has been canceled.

If your actions result in, or are likely to result in, a Payment Dispute, a violation of these Terms of Use or the creation of other risks to TrialBase or our payment processing partners, or if we determine that your Account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, then we may permanently withhold any amounts owed to you in our sole discretion.

If you have a past due balance due on any Account, or for any additional amounts that we determine you owe us, we may, without limiting any other rights or remedies: (a) charge one or more of your payment methods; (b) offset any amounts you owe us against amounts you may be owed; (c) invoice you for amounts due to us, which such amounts will be due upon receipt; (d) reverse or block any credits to your bank account; or (e) collect payment from you by any other lawful means.

If you fail to make Marketplace Payments you owe when due, or if TrialBase is unable to charge one of your payment methods for any reason, TrialBase reserves all rights permissible under law to recover payment and all costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys' fees and related costs, in our pursuit of payment. You explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts or overdue payments will be made by electronic mail or by phone. Such communication may be made by TrialBase or by anyone on our behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collections agent.

TrialBase may, from time to time, place a hold on any of your payment methods in order to prevent failed payments or in order to reverse your booking.

## Subscriptions and Automatic Renewal (If Applicable)

If TrialBase offers any subscription, free trial that converts to paid, or other automatically renewing or recurring billing arrangement for any Platform feature ("Subscription"), TrialBase will present clear and conspicuous disclosures of: (i) the amount to be charged and the charge frequency; (ii) that the Subscription will renew automatically unless canceled; and (iii) how to cancel. TrialBase will obtain your affirmative consent before charging you for a Subscription. Where required by California law, TrialBase will provide renewal and/or trial-ending reminders and will make cancellation available in a manner that is at least as easy as sign-up.

## Disputes Between or Among Users

TrialBase values our Service Professionals and Attorney Users, and we understand that occasionally disputes may arise between or among them. Our goal is to provide tools to help Users resolve such disputes independently.

In the rare event a dispute regarding an interaction related to the Platform cannot be resolved independently, you agree, at TrialBase's request, to participate in good faith, to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, in a neutral resolution or mediation conducted by TrialBase or a neutral third-party mediator or arbitrator selected by TrialBase.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that TrialBase is under no obligation to become involved in or impose resolution in any dispute between or among Users or any third-party.

## Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

You and TrialBase agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.

This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between you and TrialBase, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and TrialBase, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.

By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with TrialBase as follows:

### Initial Dispute Resolution

Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. You can reach TrialBase's support department at support@trialbase.com. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the TrialBase support department, and good faith negotiations will be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

### Binding Arbitration

If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.

Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or previous versions of these Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy's formation, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform will be finally settled by binding arbitration, as described below.

### 30-Day Right to Opt Out

You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending (from the email address you use on TrialBase) written notice of your decision to opt out to support@trialbase.com with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the later of the Effective Date of these Terms or your first use of the Platform; otherwise, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms.

### Changes to This Section

TrialBase will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section by posting on the TrialBase Terms of Use website, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the TrialBase Terms of Use website or sent to you. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the 30th day. If a court or arbitrator decides that the subsection on "Changes to This Section" is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection will be severed and the court or arbitrator will apply the first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Platform.

### Survival

This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will survive any termination of your Account or the Platform.

### Third-Party Beneficiary

You and TrialBase acknowledge that any third-party consumer reporting agency that TrialBase uses to perform background checks on Service Professionals is an express and intended third-party beneficiary of this arbitration provision and as such, the terms of this Arbitration provision will inure to the benefit of the consumer reporting agencies and may be enforced by them. Accordingly, you agree that any dispute that arises between you and a consumer reporting agency that relates to or arises out of this Agreement or any aspect of your relationship with TrialBase will be resolved by binding arbitration. If any court or arbitrator determines that this third-party beneficiary subsection is void or unenforceable, then this subsection will be severed and the remainder will remain enforceable.

## Governing Law

The Terms and the relationship between you and TrialBase will be governed in all respects by the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against TrialBase that is not subject to arbitration must be resolved by a court located in San Francisco County, California, or a United States District Court, Northern District of California, located in San Francisco, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties.

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California, for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes that are not subject to arbitration. You hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.
